# Resume

Generalist, full-stack software engineer with experience ranging from embedded systems to mobile solutions. Quality oriented: experienced practitioner of *Acceptance Test Driven Development*, *Test Driven Development* and *Continuous Integration* with experience in test automation. Solid record of public speeches and workshops. Blogging on Software Engineering at [blog.redgreenrefactor.eu]. Comfortable with both embedded and mobile/web development including *iOS*, *Google App Engine* (Phyton), *Ruby on Rails*, *ASP.NET*, and *Node.js*. Continuously working on the portfolio. Owner of artbea photography: [www.artbea.eu].

## Education
### November 2004 - October 2008  
*University of Twente, Enschede, The Netherlands.*  
Ph.D. in Computer Security, Distributed Trust Management, Logic-based Access Control.  
**Ph.D. Thesis:** *TuLiP : Reshaping Trust Management.*

The Distributed Trust Management is an approach to access control where access control decisions are made based on the security credentials. In Distributed Trust Management, every user can create (issue) credentials and can decide where the credentials are stored (this is in contrary to the traditional trust management where credentials are usually kept on a centralised location). A successful distributed trust management system consists of a language for writing credentials and an algorithm (called a compliance checker) for evaluating the credentials. The aim of the Ph.D. study was to define a trust management language and a an algorithm such that they both support the credential distribution and discovery. *TuLiP - **T**rust management system based on **L**ogic **P**rogramming* provides exactly this. The research was carried out within the *Freeband I-SHARE Dutch National* project. 

### November 1998 - October 2003
*Warsaw University of Technology, Poland.*  
MSc in Computer Science  
**Master Thesis:** *JEstelle: Novel approach to the distributed system specification and development.*

*JEstelle* combines the power of object oriented Java programming with formalism and provability of *Formal Description Techniques* (e.g. *Estelle* or *SDL*). If you never heard about Formal Description Techniques, let me just add that to some extent the UML state machine can be considered a semantical descendent of the SDL state charts. The work on JEstelle was also published in two conference papers.

## Recent Professional experience
Below I limit myself to my very recent professional experience, which will give you a good indication on the technologies I worked with most recently. I have no limits in learning new stuff though, and I will be a rapid learner through pair programming. 

### Time frame: July 2014 - present
**Company:** *Philips Lighting - contracted through TMC*  
**Position:** *Full stack Software Engineer (Embedded).*

**Job description:**

De-risking phase of a project. Responsible for all software engineering works collaborating with system architects and electrical engineers. The system developed involves two MCU architectures, *ARM* and *AVR XMEGA*, and a number of accompanying technologies including but not limited to (subject to NDA) USB Host Driver on *STM32*, *802.15.4*, and *ThreadX* embedded operating system.

The following deliverables can be identified:

- Supporting research experiments through providing adequate instrumentation: a web based, distributed, responsive-design facilitation system based on *Ruby on Rails* and *Web Socket* technology plus creating firmware for two embedded micro-controllers. Well-tested and documented. 
- Documentation of the involved technologies (programming model) to be used as a knowledge base for the product development team. 
- Full-stack test automation. Providing a complete continuous integration infrastructure around the involved system components including automated builds, automated *developer facing tests* (unit testing), and automated *customer facing tests* (end-to-end testing). This forms a ready-to-use infrastructure for the product-development phase and provides valuable insights on the impact of a number of quality practices on the delivery schedule.
- Formulation of the coding conventions and rational behind selected testing practices.

**After hours:**
Keeping up to date with iOS, learning Node.js, Anguar, React, Express, ES6.
 
**Technology:**
AVR XMEGA, ARM, 802.15.4, USB Host, USART, SPI, ThreadX, arm-gcc toolchain, avr-gcc, make, C/C++/Ruby/Python/Javascript, Ruby on Rails on Ubuntu (through Virtualization), Python virtualenv, Ruby Version Manager (rvm), Behave (Python End-to-End Testing), Cucumber (End-to-End testing for Ruby on Rails), CppUTest (Unit Testing and Mocking Framework for C and C++ languages), TeamCity Continuous Integration Server, Markdown for documentation, Git Version Control system, Jira Agile for planning and tracking. IDEs involved: Eclipse, Atmel Studio, IntelliJ IDEA, Sublime Text 2.

### Time frame: May 2014 - June 2014
**Company:** *TMC, Eindhoven, The Netherlands*  
**Position:** *Full stack Software Engineer (iOS).*

**Job description:**
Working on *iOS/Web Development Portfolio* for the *TMC Mobile Software* engineering group at TMC.
Created reference code and examples for the *iOS* and *Backend* development in *Ruby on Rails* with examples of *developer-facing* and *customer facing* tests.

**iOS:** Using *Quick Look* framework of *iOS* in order to preview PDF documents. The project uses `UITableView` to show available pdf documents and a *Facebook-like* side menu. It demonstrates the use of the following iOS APIs: 
- `UITableView` with a simple custom table view cell displaying an image, and two labels,
- Using `xcassets` to provide images for table view cells through `[UIImage imageNamed:]` class method.
- Using *QuickLook* framework to preview PDF documents.
- Using custom indexed subscripting.
- Using *view containment* to implement a Facebook-like side menu.
- Using *Pan Gesture Recognizer* to implement Pan and Swipe gestures for the side menu.
- Handling conflicting gestures recognizers: the side menu uses `UIPanGestureRecognizer` to implement side menu. `UITableView` that we use to present the list of PDF documents in the central panel uses its own pan gesture for scrolling.
- Creating smooth animations for a natural user experience when panning and swiping the menu.

**Ruby on Rails Backend:** Besides providing a bootstrap code for a simple backend it additionally demonstrates using *Cucumber* for end-to-end testing, *json_spec* for testing *JSON* content, and *Factory Girl* for a more convenient testing of the data models.

### Time frame: February 2011 - May 2014
**Company:** *[Red Green Refactor], Eindhoven, The Netherlands*  Self-funded.
**Position:** *Scrum/eXtreme Programming training and coaching, product development.*

[Red Green Refactor] provides training and consultancy services in *Scrum*, *eXtreme Programming*, and *Kanban*, focusing on engineering practices that help developers doing their job better. Red Green Refactor’s vision is a world with less management clutter and better teams of happy developers delivering quality products.

**Tasks and responsibilities:**
Creating training and coaching materials, technology research to remain up-to-date with customer requirements, training delivery, on-site coaching. One to three day trainings on *Scrum and eXtreme Programming*. On-site, embedded coaching and training. Helping organizations to embrace quality practices: *Acceptance Test Driven Development*, *Test Driven Development*, *Continuous Integration* in the environments including *Ruby on Rails*, *ASP.NET*, *Java Spring*, *Python*, *Google App Engine (Python)*, *iOS*.

**Delivery:**
Helping our customers to understand Scrum framework and - more importantly - how to benefit from it. In particular, our customers learn about Scrum roles and their responsibilities, the role of the management in an agile organization, how to plan in an agile way effectively, how to improve engineering practices, and how to avoid common mistakes when adopting agile.

**Accompanying Projects:**  
[redgreenrefactor.eu] – this page is how I displayed myself to the customers. More importantly though, it is also a place to practice *UI Browser Testing*, *Java Script Testing*, *Ruby on Rails*, deployment to *Apache* using *Passenger* and *Capistrano*. All done solely by me including (better and worse) graphics and posters.

[blog.redgreenrefactor.eu] – Red Green Refactor moves away from the consultancy, intended to become an engineering site. This technical blog paves the way.

[agile-guru.com] – a side project to [redgreenrefactor.eu]. Again, it demonstrates acceptance testing. The code (more importantly the tests) for this site can be shared on request.

*iOS and Google App Engine Development (Python)* – my experience with iOS development has been captured in a demonstration project which shows my workings with *Core Data*, *State Preservation*, and interacting with external services. It also demonstrates an approach to acceptance and unit level of testing. with iOS at that time. Acceptance Testing infrastructure is build around *Xcode UI Automation Instrument*, *Jasmine Javascript* testing, *Cucumber* with a number of *Ruby* abstractions to facilitate automation. The project also demonstrates some of my work with Python (together with *peewee* for database abstraction, *webapp2* framework, and *Jinja2* templating. Finally it demonstrates the use of *Google App Engine* (Python) as the backend. The project is accompanied with documentation describing the system setup with *virtualenv* and *virtualenvwrapper* for Python and *rvm* for Ruby. Documentation and the whole code base can be shared on request.

## Leasure time

[www.artbea.eu]: Photography - run with my wife. A great mix of art, technology, and logistics: from capturing the emotions through the lens, image processing, presentation and printing, till boxing and sending it down to the customer. You can hire us as a portrait and event photographer.

Motorbike rider, appreciating acceleration, engine sound, vibration, and the smell :). I used to renovate old motorbikes.

Decent choir experience. Sang among others Mozart's Requiem, Bach's St. John Passion, works of Monteverdi and Rachmaninoff. Regularly signing Gregorian Chant during church services. Recreational, but quite regular electric guitar player.

Former competition-level soccer player (goalkeeper). Learning playing bandy (kind of an Ice Hockey). Running to relax.

Loves animals (owning two cats - a Maine Coon and Russian Blue).
